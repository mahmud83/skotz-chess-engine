# Skotz Chess Engine #
This is my attempt to create a decently strong UCI chess engine in C# from scratch, mainly to help me think through the process enough before I eventually tackle my goal of creating a competitive chess engine in some slightly faster language such as C.

To play against this engine you will need a UCI compatible chess GUI. [Arena](http://www.playwitharena.com/) is free (and it's what I use).

Here's a game that demonstrates the current strength of the program: [Skotz v0.2 vs Skotz v0.2 - 10 seconds per move - 7/13/13](http://skotz-chess-engine.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Games%20Archive/Skotz%20v0.2/2013.07.13%20Skots%20v0.2%20%2810%20sec%29%20Self%20Play%20Checkmate.pgn)

When reporting bugs, please attach the three *.out.txt files in the engine's directory. This will help me reproduce the error more easily.

This project was exported from Google Code.
